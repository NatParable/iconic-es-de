# Alekfull NX (ES-DE Version)
This is port of the AlekFull NX theme by [fagnerpc](https://github.com/fagnerpc) for the version of EmulationStation used in [ES-DE](https://es-de.org/) v2.x

**All artwork and layouts were designed and created by fagnerpc.  I simply made changes to the XML to make the theme compatible with ES-DE. The original version of the theme can be found [here](https://github.com/fagnerpc/Alekfull-NX)**

## Changes Made

- Removed all Batocera specific elements to make the theme compatible with ES-DE v2.x
- Updated system image names to match the standard used by ES-DE
- Added a 16:10 Layout Variant
- Added navigation sound set for ES-DE

## **Configuration Options**

- The theme has a simple set of options that can be changed directly from the UI Settings menu of ES-DE
- `Theme Aspect Ratio` - sets the aspect ratio the theme will render at. If needed, this can be changed to match the aspect ratio of your screen (though it should happen automatically).
   - 16:9 and 16:10 are supported
- `Theme Variant` - sets the layout used for the gamelist view when media & metadata are scraped for your games.  There are 4 variants to choose from:
   - `List: Metadata & Miximage` - A simple list that displays the miximage artwork and shows all game metadata
   - `List: Metadata & Boxart` - A simple list that displays cover artwork and shows all game metadata
   - `List: Miximage` - A simple list that removes all gamemetadata and displays miximage artwork
   - `List: Boxart` - A simple list that removes all gamemetadata and displays cover artwork
- `Theme Color Scheme` - sets the color scheme that is used for the overall theme on all views.  There are 7 built in color schems to choose from:
   - `Light`
   - `Dark`
- `Theme Font Size` - enables you to change the size of the fonts displayed in the theme
   - `Medium` - good for display on tvs and computer monitors
   - `Large` - good for display on large handheld screens at 6 inches or larger
   - `Extra Large` - good for display on small handheld screens at 6 inches or below
