## **Theme Customizations**

This theme allows customizations to artwork without the need to edit the source XML.  This enables you to change the look of the theme and still retain any changes when the root theme is updated.

### Start Here 
- Make sure `Light (Custom Artwork)`, `Dark (Custom Artwork)`, or `Retro Gray (Custom Artwork)`  is selected from `Menu > UI Settings > Theme Variant`
- This setting changes the directories that the theme looks for artwork in and sets up the ability for you to add custom artwork.
- If desired, users can mix and match classic/modern art. There is also an alternate background/overlay folder that can give additional options.

### Backgrounds
- Use the folder called `custom-backgrounds` in ES-DE's theme directory at: `ES-DE/themes/iconic-es-de/_inc/systems`
- Copy your custom background images to that folder
- They should be named:
    - ${system.theme}.jpg
    - _default.jpg
- `${system.theme}.jpg` should be named for the system you are looking to override.  For example if you wanted to override the artwork for `snes` you would create an image called `snes.jpg` in the backgrounds folder.
- If a given ${system.theme}.jpg image is not found, it will use _default.jpg image, so make sure to keep that file.
  
### Overlays
- Custom overlays can be added to help make images pop.
- These should be in a 16:9 1920x1080 aspect ratio and a .png format to have the desired effect.
- Use the folder called `custom-overlay` in ES-DE's theme directory at: `ES-DE/themes/iconic-es-de/_inc/systems`
- Upload your custom overlay images to that folder. Be aware that these will appear on top of all other assets on that screen.
- They should be named:
    - ${system.theme}.png

## **Additional Notes**

This theme may be resource intensive due to the layering of images. This is especially true when utilizing the grid view. Increasing the VRAM limit under "Other Settings" within the ES-DE menu is useful if pop-in is experienced.
